      "content": "AZURA 1.\n\nThe laughter rang in my ears but there was nothing merry about it, filled with malice and jeers.\n\nвЂњGo on!вЂќ\n\nвЂњAwe, whatвЂ™s wrong, too much of a wimp?вЂќ\n\nвЂњYouвЂ™re meant to be the boss' woman, can't you do it? Too weak?вЂќ\n\nI freeze, standing between my boyfriend and his men. They are torturing someone who I donвЂ™t even recognize in his wolf form, but what else is new, this is the usual for them. I always tried to ignore his ways and stayed out of his business. I tried to focus on the good in him instead, but today, they expect me to join in with their sick games.\n\nI donвЂ™t want to do this, staring at the bloody mass on the ground, my stomach churns. This was not meant to happen.\n\nвЂњJust pull the trigger.вЂќ His voice is devoid of emotions, his cold murky eyes meet mine as he holds the gun out to me.\n\nвЂњI... I'm not so sure about this, this wasnвЂ™t what you told me.вЂќ I reply calmly, despite the way my stomach is twisting with nerves.\n\nвЂњNot even for me, my little Pet?вЂќ He tilts his head, looking at me whilst the rest of his friends spur me on.\n\nI stare at the gun, trying to think how I got hereвЂ¦\n\nBut I donвЂ™t know when I fell into this toxic relationship. IвЂ™m not someone who needs sympathy, I was never one who couldnвЂ™t sleep at night because of my demons. I was always carefree, unbothered, and wild. I loved to have fun, crush on the good-looking boys in my class, or whatever hot Alpha crossed my path. But nowвЂ¦ I find myself tossing and turning, trying to push the nightmares my so-called boyfriend has pulled me into.\n\nвЂњPlease, come on, letвЂ™s forget this.вЂќ I try to shrug it off, wrapping my arms around his neck and hoping he listens.\n\nHis scent fills my nose, mixed with the smell of cigarettes and drugs. His hands stroked my waist and I tried to remember the man I had fallen in love with.\n\nWhere has he gone?\n\nвЂњForget what? Oh yeah, forget what he called you? Let me rephrase that, little Pet, you donвЂ™t want to be an outcast, do you? The outsiderвЂ¦ The odd one outвЂ¦ The freak?вЂќ His tone is a cold sneer, as his eyes burn into mine.\n\nFreak.\n\nMy heart thumps as I stare at the bloody wolf on the ground.\n\nIвЂ™m not a freak.\n\nI am Azura Rayne Westwood, daughter of the previous Alpha of the Blood Moon Pack. Even though I was a child born in a way that played with the very laws of nature, IвЂ™m not a freak.\n\nI should be dead, but I'm not.\n\nвЂњFreak. Freak. FreakвЂќ His men begin to chant only making the anger rise within me. He smirks, knowing itвЂ™s getting to me, making me yank away from his hold, my heart thumps violently as I snatch the weapon from his hand.\n\nI remember when I was a child, I didn't understand why I was disliked. Occasionally there were kids in the Pack whispering behind my back, but they didn't dare to do anything to me because I was the daughter of their Alpha. Plus, I was not someone to mess with, I always made anyone who tried to hurt me or those I loved, suffer.\n\nHowever, there was one name that never left me - The Freak.\n\nвЂњDo it.вЂќ\n\nI look at my boyfriend, he knows I hate that term, but he still uses itвЂ¦ ItвЂ™s my fault, I was the one blind enough to tell him my darkest secrets.\n\nвЂњFine.вЂќ I spit as I turn, pretending to do his bidding and raising the gun.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nвЂњShoot him, Baby.вЂќ His quiet voice laced with a deadly warning, came from right behind me.\n\nMy hand shakes as I stare at the whimpering wolf on the floor.\n\nHis breathing is so shallowвЂ¦\n\nNo amount of logic makes this okay.\n\nI am not going to do this, but the urge to turn around and shoot my so-called boyfriend instead tempts me.\n\nI lower my weapon, the laughter fading as a tense silence falls at my act of disobedience.\n\nвЂњI'm not going-вЂќ\n\nI gasp when something knocks into me from behind, making me accidentally pull the trigger, the body on the ground shivers before it stills.\n\nвЂњNo!вЂќ I scream, dropping the gun, as I run to the wolfвЂ™s side.\n\nNo, no, no!\n\nLaughter follows me as I look at the wolf before me, I canвЂ™t feel his heartbeat, but he doesnвЂ™t even shift to his human form. Whatever those bullets contain, is deadly, it is so fast he couldnвЂ™t even shift back.\n\nвЂњWhy, Judah!вЂќ I scream.\n\nSilence fell as I glared at the man who stood there, his cold eyes on me. Although he said nothing, the anger in his eyes made my blood run cold. He hates to be disrespected.\n\nвЂњYou do not talk to me like that.вЂќ He whispers menacingly as he strides over to me. Grabbing a fistful of the wolfвЂ™s bloody fur, he lifted his body from the ground in one sweep. вЂњYou did this.вЂќ With those words, he throws the heavy body of the dead wolf on top of me, the weight crushing my legs.\n\nвЂњDo you feel sorry for him? Here, take care of him!вЂќ He snarls as I glare back at him. My anger rises as I try to push the body of the wolf off me. вЂњWho said you can get up, my Pet?вЂќ\n\nвЂњThis is not a joke! I'm done with you and your sick ways.вЂќ I spit resentfully.\n\nHeвЂ™s no different from all of the others, heвЂ™s worse.\n\nHis eyes darken and he grabs a fistful of my hair.\n\nвЂњOh, we arenвЂ™t done until I say we are.вЂќ He snarls menacingly.\n\nвЂњYou donвЂ™t own me, and I am not your pet!вЂќ I hiss, glaring at him with defiance.\n\nHe simply laughed loudly, as my childish words amused him, but I knew better. He was beyond angry; I had just disrespected him in front of his men. He wonвЂ™t forgive that.\n\nвЂњYeah, I will. I'm done with you.вЂќ I spit, my heart pounding with rage.\n\nHe tugged my head back violently and using the hand that he had grabbed the wolf with, he rubbed the blood over my face roughly, before shoving me onto the ground roughly.\n\nвЂњI think itвЂ™s time I show you exactly who you belong to.вЂќ He spat as he hit me across the face, making my vision darken...\n\n-\n\nI lurch upright in bed, my entire body is soaked with sweat as the memories of that night fill my mind once more. My heart is thumping violently as I look around, and it takes me a few moments to realize I am in my bedroom. Safe.\n\nTaking a shaking breath, I get out of bed and walk to the adjoining bathroom, splashing my face with water.\n\nIt has been a year since I walked away from my toxic ex, one year since I thought I was done with him for good. Until two days ago when I received a video of that night along with the message: вЂ\u0098Remember that I know what you did.вЂ™\n\nMy stomach knots, feeling sick as the words ring in my head.\n\nI turned the tap off and took a deep breath, returning to my bedroom.\n\nIвЂ™m safe hereвЂ¦ right?\n\nNo matter how many times I think it over, I donвЂ™t know how I got involved with him.\n\nThe worst part is that if my parents knew, they would be more than disappointed in me, and the one thing I hate most, is letting them down.\n\nEven though my parents are no longer the Alphas, they are still highly respected, their reputation is known across the country and Dad is on the Alpha KingвЂ™s Council. He is also one of the Elite Eleven, a title that had been unofficially given to the selection of the most powerful Alphas of our time and here I am making things worse for them.\n\nI wish I never met him, and I wish I could turn back time. Glancing at the clock, I realize itвЂ™s five in the morning.\n\nI should try to get some rest. I turned the lamp off, just as my phone beeps.\n\nTensing, I frown as I stare at the sleek device. Taking a deep breath, I unlocked it and read the message.\n\nвЂ\u0098CanвЂ™t sleep? Well, IвЂ™ll give you something more to think about. Come back to me or I think your entire family would love to watch all those videos. Do you want them to see exactly how FREAKY their little girl can get?вЂ™\n\nI know what other videos he means and it makes me sick.\n\nI covered my mouth unconsciously, my stomach twisting sickeningly as I glanced towards my window.\n\nHe is watching me.\n\nI walked over to the window and peered out. My heart thumps as I scan the darkness outside.\n\nNothing.\n\nI canвЂ™t see anything out of the ordinaryвЂ¦ Is he just messing with me?\n\nMy phone beep again and I look down at the new message that pops up on the screen, a message that makes my blood run cold.\n\nвЂ\u0098I see you still sleep in your underwear.вЂ™"

Plus, I was not someone to mess with, I always made anyone who tried to hurt me or those I loved, suffer.\n\nHowever, there was one name that never left me - The Freak.\n\nвЂњDo it.вЂќ\n\nI look at my boyfriend, he knows I hate that term, but he still uses itвЂ¦ ItвЂ™s my fault, I was the one blind enough to tell him my darkest secrets.\n\nвЂњFine.вЂќ I spit as I turn, pretending to do his bidding and raising the gun.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nвЂњShoot him, Baby.вЂќ His quiet voice laced with a deadly warning, came from right behind me.\n\nMy hand shakes as I stare at the whimpering wolf on the floor.\n\nHis breathing is so shallowвЂ¦\n\nNo amount of logic makes this okay.\n\nI am not going to do this, but the urge to turn around and shoot my so-called boyfriend instead tempts me.\n\nI lower my weapon, the laughter fading as a tense silence falls at my act of disobedience.\n\nвЂњI'm not going-вЂќ\n\nI gasp when something knocks into me from behind, making me accidentally pull the trigger, the body on the ground shivers before it stills.\n\nвЂњNo!вЂќ I scream, dropping the gun, as I run to the wolfвЂ™s side.\n\nNo, no, no!\n\nLaughter follows me as I look at the wolf before me, I canвЂ™t feel his heartbeat, but he doesnвЂ™t even shift to his human form. Whatever those bullets contain, is deadly, it is so fast he couldnвЂ™t even shift back.\n\nвЂњWhy, Judah!вЂќ I scream.\n\nSilence fell as I glared at the man who stood there, his cold eyes on me. Although he said nothing, the anger in his eyes made my blood run cold. He hates to be disrespected.\n\nвЂњYou do not talk to me like that.вЂќ He whispers menacingly as he strides over to me. Grabbing a fistful of the wolfвЂ™s bloody fur, he lifted his body from the ground in one sweep. вЂњYou did this.вЂќ With those words, he throws the heavy body of the dead wolf on top of me, the weight crushing my legs.\n\nвЂњDo you feel sorry for him? Here, take care of him!вЂќ He snarls as I glare back at him. My anger rises as I try to push the body of the wolf off me. вЂњWho said you can get up, my Pet?вЂќ\n\nвЂњThis is not a joke! I'm done with you and your sick ways.вЂќ I spit resentfully.\n\nHeвЂ™s no different from all of the others, heвЂ™s worse.\n\nHis eyes darken and he grabs a fistful of my hair.\n\nвЂњOh, we arenвЂ™t done until I say we are.вЂќ He snarls menacingly.\n\nвЂњYou donвЂ™t own me, and I am not your pet!вЂќ I hiss, glaring at him with defiance.\n\nHe simply laughed loudly, as my childish words amused him, but I knew better. He was beyond angry; I had just disrespected him in front of his men. He wonвЂ™t forgive that.\n\nвЂњYeah, I will. I'm done with you.вЂќ I spit, my heart pounding with rage.\n\nHe tugged my head back violently and using the hand that he had grabbed the wolf with, he rubbed the blood over my face roughly, before shoving me onto the ground roughly.\n\nвЂњI think itвЂ™s time I show you exactly who you belong to.вЂќ He spat as he hit me across the face, making my vision darken...\n\n-\n\nI lurch upright in bed, my entire body is soaked with sweat as the memories of that night fill my mind once more. My heart is thumping violently as I look around, and it takes me a few moments to realize I am in my bedroom. Safe.\n\nTaking a shaking breath, I get out of bed and walk to the adjoining bathroom, splashing my face with water.\n\nIt has been a year since I walked away from my toxic ex, one year since I thought I was done with him for good. Until two days ago when I received a video of that night along with the message: вЂ\u0098Remember that I know what you did.вЂ™\n\nMy stomach knots, feeling sick as the words ring in my head.\n\nI turned the tap off and took a deep breath, returning to my bedroom.\n\nIвЂ™m safe hereвЂ¦ right?\n\nNo matter how many times I think it over, I donвЂ™t know how I got involved with him.\n\nThe worst part is that if my parents knew, they would be more than disappointed in me, and the one thing I hate most, is letting them down.\n\nEven though my parents are no longer the Alphas, they are still highly respected, their reputation is known across the country and Dad is on the Alpha KingвЂ™s Council. He is also one of the Elite Eleven, a title that had been unofficially given to the selection of the most powerful Alphas of our time and here I am making things worse for them.\n\nI wish I never met him, and I wish I could turn back time. Glancing at the clock, I realize itвЂ™s five in the morning.\n\nI should try to get some rest. I turned the lamp off, just as my phone beeps.\n\nTensing, I frown as I stare at the sleek device. Taking a deep breath, I unlocked it and read the message.\n\nвЂ\u0098CanвЂ™t sleep? Well, IвЂ™ll give you something more to think about. Come back to me or I think your entire family would love to watch all those videos. Do you want them to see exactly how FREAKY their little girl can get?вЂ™\n\nI know what other videos he means and it makes me sick.\n\nI covered my mouth unconsciously, my stomach twisting sickeningly as I glanced towards my window.\n\nHe is watching me.\n\nI walked over to the window and peered out. My heart thumps as I scan the darkness outside.\n\nNothing.\n\nI canвЂ™t see anything out of the ordinaryвЂ¦ Is he just messing with me?\n\nMy phone beep again and I look down at the new message that pops up on the screen, a message that makes my blood run cold.\n\nвЂ\u0098I see you still sleep in your underwear.вЂ™"

      "content": "AZURA 5.\n\nThe laughter rang in my ears but there was nothing merry about it, filled with malice and jeers.\n\nвЂњGo on!вЂќ\n\nвЂњAwe, whatвЂ™s wrong, too much of a wimp?вЂќ\n\nвЂњYouвЂ™re meant to be the boss' woman, can't you do it? Too weak?вЂќ\n\nI freeze, standing between my boyfriend and his men. They are torturing someone who I donвЂ™t even recognize in his wolf form, but what else is new, this is the usual for them. I always tried to ignore his ways and stayed out of his business. I tried to focus on the good in him instead, but today, they expect me to join in with their sick games.\n\nI donвЂ™t want to do this, staring at the bloody mass on the ground, my stomach churns. This was not meant to happen.\n\nвЂњJust pull the trigger.вЂќ His voice is devoid of emotions, his cold murky eyes meet mine as he holds the gun out to me.\n\nвЂњI... I'm not so sure about this, this wasnвЂ™t what you told me.вЂќ I reply calmly, despite the way my stomach is twisting with nerves.\n\nвЂњNot even for me, my little Pet?вЂќ He tilts his head, looking at me whilst the rest of his friends spur me on.\n\nI stare at the gun, trying to think how I got hereвЂ¦\n\nBut I donвЂ™t know when I fell into this toxic relationship. IвЂ™m not someone who needs sympathy, I was never one who couldnвЂ™t sleep at night because of my demons. I was always carefree, unbothered, and wild. I loved to have fun, crush on the good-looking boys in my class, or whatever hot Alpha crossed my path. But nowвЂ¦ I find myself tossing and turning, trying to push the nightmares my so-called boyfriend has pulled me into.\n\nвЂњPlease, come on, letвЂ™s forget this.вЂќ I try to shrug it off, wrapping my arms around his neck and hoping he listens.\n\nHis scent fills my nose, mixed with the smell of cigarettes and drugs. His hands stroked my waist and I tried to remember the man I had fallen in love with.\n\nWhere has he gone?\n\nвЂњForget what? Oh yeah, forget what he called you? Let me rephrase that, little Pet, you donвЂ™t want to be an outcast, do you? The outsiderвЂ¦ The odd one outвЂ¦ The freak?вЂќ His tone is a cold sneer, as his eyes burn into mine.\n\nFreak.\n\nMy heart thumps as I stare at the bloody wolf on the ground.\n\nIвЂ™m not a freak.\n\nI am Azura Rayne Westwood, daughter of the previous Alpha of the Blood Moon Pack. Even though I was a child born in a way that played with the very laws of nature, IвЂ™m not a freak.\n\nI should be dead, but I'm not.\n\nвЂњFreak. Freak.
